# Role: Community Partnerships

The community partnerships team plays a key role in fostering relationships with diverse tech communities. Our aim is to provide meaningful support, ensuring that these communities benefit from their collaboration with IndiaFOSS.

For IndiaFOSS 2024, instead of expecting communities to regularly promote the event, we focused on offering a platform to communities that align with our values. The new objective was to give them the opportunity to showcase their initiatives/projects/demos and amplify their voices within the open-source ecosystem.

Partnerships involve continuous communication with community leaders/representatives to ensure they have the tools and information needed to collaborate effectively. This includes helping them engage with IndiaFOSS, facilitating joint efforts, and providing visibility to their initiatives.

During the conference, the community partnerships team also ensures that partners are well-supported and feel involved as a part of family.

## Things to Keep in Mind:

**Effective Communication:** Maintain clear and consistent communication with partners.
**Supportive Role:** Ensure each community partner feels encouraged and valued throughout their involvement.
**Teamwork:** Collaborate with other teams to align partnership goals with the broader event strategy.

## Responsibilities:

Keep community partners informed about the event and collaboration opportunities.
Address any queries or concerns partners might have regarding their role.
Help ensure a smooth collaboration between community partners and the event team.

**Things for Next Year, maybe?**

For future editions, rather than just asking community partners to share social posts of IndiaFOSS, spreading more awareness about FOSS United's philosophy and how the foundation operates can be a priority. A potential initiative could be designing an informative poster about the foundationâ€™s philosophy, which community partners can share within their networks. This will help raise awareness about FOSS United and create a coordinated marketing effort for both IndiaFOSS and the foundation.
