# Diversity Workgroup Responsibilities

## Team and maintaining effective communication

A dedicated and communicative team. Each member should be comfortable with sending multiple emails, making follow-ups, and keeping the conversation flowing within the team and potential speakers, Diversity Scholars (for diversity scholarship), and organisations.

The team should collaborate in identifying individuals and organisations within the FOSS community, renowned speakers, and experts from diverse fields such as design, science, government, education, policy, and public good sectors also ensuring diversity in terms of gender, regional representation, and expertise. A balanced approach helps showcase different voices and experiences. Clear internal communication protocols are essential to manage outreach efforts efficiently and avoid duplicating tasks.

## Reaching out to the community for referrals

A key task is identifying speakers who can bring diverse perspectives. This includes looking beyond the typical names and encouraging new voices, especially from marginalized communities.

It’s important to tap into the existing network for speaker recommendations. Previous speakers, community members, or peers from similar conferences often have valuable suggestions. This is a quick and effective way to get in touch with experienced speakers who already have a relationship with the community.

Divide outreach work within the group. Regularly reach out to past speakers and ask them to refer new potential speakers. Personalized outreach often yields better results. Maintaining these connections can help create a steady flow of diverse speakers.

## Sourcing speakers from the FOSS community

One of the core responsibilities of the workgroup is to source speakers who are active in the FOSS space. These speakers can come from within the community or be referred to by others. It’s important to ensure that the speakers selected bring a mix of technical and non-technical perspectives to the event.

Focus: When selecting speakers, prioritize those who have demonstrated meaningful contributions to FOSS or have a background in FOSS space. This helps ensure that the content delivered at the event is relevant and aligned with the core values of the community.

## Managing diversity scholarships

The diversity scholarship program is designed to support individuals from underrepresented communities who are interested in attending the event. When managing this program, it’s important to prioritise candidates who already have some exposure to FOSS. These individuals are more likely to benefit from the event and make meaningful connections with the community. Reaching out to organisations and individuals that work with gender minorities, women, and communities from tier 2 and tier 3 cities can significantly enhance the diversity of attendees. This can be done by contacting organisations that have a track record of advocating for these groups or by soliciting referrals from within the community.


**Selection:** Make sure to have clear criteria for the scholarship, prioritizing those who demonstrate interest in FOSS. Candidates who can articulate how the event would benefit their FOSS journey should be given special attention. Organise a transparent and efficient system for processing applications and communicating results.Connect with educational institutions, NGOs, and community organisations. Keep a clear system for sorting applications and a proper sheet with all the details of approached organisations to avoid multiple approaches. Build relationships with these organisations early in the planning process. They can often provide access to potential scholars and participants who are not yet deeply involved in FOSS but are keen to learn. Use their networks to promote the event and scholarship opportunities to ensure a broad and inclusive reach.


## Maintaining longterm relationships with Diversity Scholars/ speakers

After the event, it is important to maintain contact with diversity scholars/speakers. They can help amplify the work of the community within their own network, whether at their schools, colleges, or workplaces. Keeping them engaged in the community beyond the event also increases the chances that they will return as future participants, volunteers, or speakers.

**Post-event:** Send follow-up emails and maintain communication with past scholars. Encourage them to share their experiences and spread the word about the event in their local communities. This can be an effective way of expanding outreach for future editions of the event.

## Providing support to speakers and diversity scholars

Supporting speakers and scholars is key to ensuring their experience is positive and enriching. This involves clear communication before the event, addressing their logistical needs (like travel and accommodation), and offering any resources or assistance required during the event itself. Make sure to send detailed instructions to speakers and scholars well in advance, covering everything from the schedule to logistical arrangements. It’s important to establish a point of contact for any queries or issues they may have, ensuring they feel supported throughout the process. Regular check-ins, either via email or phone, can help smooth out any issues before they become problems.

## Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for all

It’s essential to make the event accessible and inclusive for everyone, including differently abled attendees. This includes ensuring that the venue is accessible (ramps, elevators, etc.), providing sign language interpreters if needed, and offering any other necessary accommodations. Rooms for people to just relax if they feel overstimulated during the conference and need some time to relax and should also be communicated well in advance.

Mothers attending the event with infants or young children require special accommodations. These may include setting up a designated area for breastfeeding or offering childcare services to help them fully participate in the event. If possible, provide on-site childcare services or information on nearby childcare facilities. Communicate these options well in advance to mothers so they can plan accordingly.

Include a section in the registration form where attendees can specify any accessibility needs, dietary restrictions, or other accommodations. Once these needs are identified, work closely with the relevant teams to ensure all requirements are met, whether it’s providing transportation assistance, dietary accommodations, or support for individuals with sensory sensitivities.

## Collaboration with other volunteers


Collaboration between different workgroups (like content or logistics) is vital to ensure smooth functioning. Proper social media marketing should be done for both diverse speakers and diversity scholarship. Delegating tasks and ensuring everyone understands their roles can make the workload manageable and less overwhelming. Have clear internal communication protocols in place. Holding regular check-ins can help avoid overlap and keep work balanced among members. Hold regular inter-workgroup meetings to sync efforts, ensuring that diversity and inclusion considerations are embedded into every aspect of the event, from content to logistics.

## Feedback from the participants, speakers, and scholars

Implement a feedback system where speakers and scholars can share their experiences. This helps identify any gaps in support or areas where the diversity workgroup could improve. Send post-event feedback form to speakers and scholars asking for input on the event’s inclusivity efforts. Use this feedback to refine the outreach and selection processes.
