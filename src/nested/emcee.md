# Emcees

## IndiaFOSS Emcee’ing Responsibilities

- There are typically two emcees per auditorium and they can collectively figure out how they want to present, one way is to take turns alternating emcee’s for speakers. 

- After deciding which Speakers you’ll be introducing as the Emcee, ideally prepare what you’re going to say beforehand and have the “script” printed out.

- The Speaker response sheet which includes their bio and talk description in the way the speaker themselves would like to state them is usually the key reference while preparing the emcee script. An additional reference is the content team’s captions for the social media posts 😄.

- Make sure you know the password for the wifi, the FOSS United provisioned laptops which the speakers present from.

- Make sure you get to know the Audi logistics volunteer who will be there to overlook and help out in case of last-minute technical challenges and that you have their contact information, (phone numbers are definitely more convenient than having their telegram since in some cases people can have their telegram-call-reception switched off).

- Ensure the speaker for the next talk is present atleast 20 minutes before the current talk ends.

- Have a quick word with the next speaker going over how they will be presenting and in case they have any special requirements.

- Announcements promoting other activities that will be starting / going on in other parts of the conference. Sometimes speakers also have a Birds-of-Feather session or a booth in place which can be promoted uness they don’t shout them out themselves.

- This is oddly specific but sometimes the wifi doesn’t work and you have to resort to personal hotspot. Make sure your phone has enough battery or the battery-saving modes don’t interfere!
