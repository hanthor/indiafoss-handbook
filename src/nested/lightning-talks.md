# Lightning Talks

Lightning talks are true unconference style, unplanned talks. At IndiaFOSS 2024, we allotted 1 hr for lightning talks.

We set up a white board where anyone could write what they want to talk about. Talk slots are allotted on first come first serve basis, and while there is no set theme - the talk should follow the [proposal guidelines](https://forum.fossunited.org/t/talk-proposal-guidelines-for-a-foss-conference-meetup/1923)

After a quick vetting process by a CFP review volunteer (to make sure none of the proposals violate the guidelines) the talks are finalised. Each speaker gets 10 minutes to present their talk.

Responsibilities are same as for [audi management volunteers](./audi-management.md)
